Here's a 16-day training plan focusing exclusively on functional components based on hooks, for ReactJS, Redux, and unit testing with Jest & Enzyme:
Day 1: Introduction to ReactJS with Hooks
•	What is React and why use it?
•	Setting up a new React project with Vite
•	Understanding JSX syntax
•	Functional Components
•	State with useState
•	Effects with useEffect
•	Assignment: Create a simple counter application using functional components and hooks
Day 2: Advanced React Hooks
•	Context with useContext
•	Ref with useRef
•	Callback with useCallback
•	Memoization with useMemo
•	Custom Hooks
•	Assignment: Enhance the counter application, add a feature to store counter history.
Day 3: React Router with Hooks
•	What is React Router?
•	Setting up React Router in a project
•	useParams, useHistory, and useLocation hooks
•	Route protection and authentication
•	Assignment: Add routes to the counter app. Each counter has its own route.
Day 4: Introduction to Redux with Hooks
•	Why use Redux?
•	Core concepts: Actions, Reducers, Store
•	Setting up Redux Toolkit
•	Redux Hooks: useSelector, useDispatch, useStore
•	Assignment: Create a simple to-do app using React and Redux with hooks.
Day 5: Advanced Redux with Redux Toolkit & Async Operations
•	Slice concept in Redux Toolkit
•	createAsyncThunk for async actions
•	ExtraReducers to handle async states
•	Assignment: Enhance the to-do app to fetch data from an API using Redux Toolkit.
Day 6: Further into Redux & Middleware
•	Middleware in Redux
•	React-Redux hooks: useStore, useActions
•	Normalization of state
•	Assignment: Implement a feature in the to-do app where tasks have categories, and they can be filtered.
Day 7: Introduction to Jest & Enzyme for Functional Components – Unit Test
•	What is Jest and why use it?
•	Setting up Jest with Create React App
•	Introduction to Enzyme
•	Testing functional components with hooks
•	Assignment: Write tests for the counter app components.
Day 8: Testing Redux Logic
•	Testing Redux reducers and actions
•	Mocking modules using Jest
•	Testing async actions and middleware
•	Assignment: Write tests for the to-do app actions and reducers.
Day 9: Deep Dive into Testing React Components
•	Shallow vs. full rendering in Enzyme
•	Testing component interactions and effects
•	Testing custom hooks
•	Assignment: Write tests for the to-do app components and its interactions.
Day 10: Wrap Up & Best Practices
•	Performance optimization in React and Redux with hooks.
•	Best practices: code splitting, lazy loading.
•	Jest & Enzyme best practices.
•	Final project: Create a simple e-commerce app using the concepts learned and write tests for it.


Each day a mix of theoretical sessions, hands-on coding, and assignments.
By the end of the training, the participants should feel adept at building and testing applications using React, Redux with hooks, Jest, and Enzyme.
